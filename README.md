# FinalProjectCMI
This is the final project within the Data Engineering & Machine Learning Course from the CMI Team.
This project is designed as an API, while using the MongoDB and Mongoengine as ORM. The api got a basic /home route with GET, 2 routes for Register & Login a specific user that goes straight into the DB, a route designed for Lead Creation where you can upload & fill it with photo and info about that lead. This is it for the moment, i`ll come back with updates, work still in progress.
